# tabs-tabs-tabs
iOS app to play around with UITabBarController.


This app is serves two purposes:
- Shows the essential working of UITabBarController
- Handles the unavailability of Safe View for iOS 8.* gracefully.

If you run this app in iPhone X, it will have the similar experience as that of a notchless device due to the custom implementation of the `Safe View`
